## Introduction

LiberoLinux is designed to give users the freedom to create a tailored Linux distribution. Whether you want to build a minimal system, a desktop environment, or a server, LiberoLinux provides the tools to do so with ease.

## Features

- **Modular Build System:** Build only the components you need.
- **Customizable:** Tailor your Linux distribution to your specific needs.
- **Lightweight:** Focus on performance and efficiency.
- **Open Source:** Completely free and open-source.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- A Linux-based operating system (Debian/Ubuntu, Arch, Fedora, etc.)
- Basic knowledge of shell scripting and Linux system administration
- Required packages: `bash`, `coreutils`, `gcc`, `make`, `wget`, `curl`, `git`

## Getting Started

To get started with building LiberoLinux, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/liberolinux/Build.git
   cd Build
   ```

2. **Install necessary dependencies:**

   Depending on your base system, install the required packages. For example, on Debian/Ubuntu:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install -y build-essential wget curl git
   ```

3. **Configure your build:**

   Edit the configuration files in the `configs` directory to set up your desired build environment.

4. **Start the build process:**

   Run the build script to start building LiberoLinux:

   ```bash
   ./build.sh
   ```

   The script will download, compile, and install the selected components based on your configuration.

## Usage

After building, you can:

- **Install the system** to a new partition or disk.
- **Create a bootable ISO** for distribution or personal use.
- **Customize further** by modifying the build scripts and configuration files.
